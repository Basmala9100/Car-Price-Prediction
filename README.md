# üöó Car Price Prediction

### üìú **Overview**  
The ability to accurately predict car prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. This project leverages machine learning to develop a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its features. The dataset used includes various attributes such as make, model, mileage, engine specifications, and fuel type, allowing the model to learn patterns that influence car prices.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to build an optimized model that can provide accurate price estimations.

### üöÄ **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Data was sourced from Kaggle.
   [Dataset](https://github.com/Basmala9100/Car-Price-Prediction/blob/main/CarPrice_Assignment.csv)
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding for model compatibility.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing price distributions, correlations, and key trends affecting car prices.
   - Identifying which features have the highest impact on pricing.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Transforming categorical features using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaling numerical features for better model performance.

4. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Implementing various models such as:
      Linear Regression
      Decision Trees
      Random Forest
      Gradient Boosting Models
   - Evaluating models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ score.
